Cover Letter


I hope this message finds you well. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to propose my services for the development of the Tekla API tool as described in the provided documents.


I am a Civil Engineer with a specialization in Steel Structures, and I bring extensive expertise in C# development, particularly in the context of construction software APIs. Over the years, I have successfully utilized APIs for various construction software applications, including AutoCAD, Revit, Navisworks, SAP2000, and Tekla Structures. My experience in combining engineering knowledge with software development skills uniquely positions me to excel in delivering the Tekla API tool you require.


I have reviewed the attached documents, including the documentation file and the Tekla model. I have a comprehensive understanding of your project's requirements and objectives. Rest assured; I am fully committed to delivering a solution that precisely aligns with your needs.


Allow me to highlight one of my recent projects in Tekla API development. I designed a Tekla plugin that functioned as a Connection Mapper. This plugin gathered all data related to connection clashes and seamlessly exported it into an Excel format. This innovative tool provided Connection Design Engineers with the precise information required to identify duplicated connections efficiently.


I propose a systematic approach to this project. I will commence by developing a user-friendly WPF Dialog User Interface (UI) that ensures a seamless user experience. Subsequently, I will work on each attribute to guarantee flawless functionality.


I estimate that this project can be completed within a timeframe of 30 days. During this period, I plan to deliver the Jamps and Piers components within 18 days, followed by the rest of the core logic of the tool within a week. The final week will be dedicated to addressing any issues, feedback, or additional requirements you may have. Throughout the development process, I will maintain open communication with you to accommodate any changes or enhancements you desire.

I am genuinely excited about the prospect of collaborating with you on this project. Your vision aligns perfectly with my skill set, and I am dedicated to ensuring its successful realization.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification. I eagerly await your response and the opportunity to contribute to your project's success.

Warm regards,

[Ahmed Salah]
